# Multi-Platform AI Agent Implementation Guide Platform-Specific Implementations

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. Docker MySQL Connection Failures**
```bash
# Check if container is running
docker ps

# Check logs
docker logs northwind

# Restart if needed
docker restart northwind

# Test connection
docker exec -it northwind mysql -uroot -psupersecret -e "USE northwind; SHOW TABLES;"
```

**2. OpenAI API Rate Limits**
- Implement exponential backoff
- Use GPT-4.1-mini for cost efficiency
- Monitor usage at platform.openai.com/usage

**3. FAISS Index Issues**
```python
# Recreate index if corrupted
import shutil
shutil.rmtree("company_memos_index", ignore_errors=True)
# Restart application to rebuild
```

**4. Platform-Specific Issues**

**N8N**: 
- Ensure credentials are properly configured
- Check node execution order
- Use console.log for debugging

**Flowise**:
- Verify all nodes are connected
- Check vector store upsert operations
- Monitor AgentFlow execution logs

**LangFlow**:  
- Validate component connections
- Test individual components separately
- Check Python environment compatibility

**LangChain**:
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check environment variable loading
- Monitor agent execution traces

## Production Deployment Notes

### Security Considerations
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Implement rate limiting and authentication
- Regular security updates for all dependencies

### Performance Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed vector embeddings
- Implement connection pooling for MySQL
- Use Redis for session management
- Monitor and log all agent decisions

### Scaling Recommendations
- Use managed vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate) for production
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Add fallback mechanisms for agent failures
- Use load balancers for high availability

This comprehensive implementation guide provides working solutions across all four platforms, with consistent behavior and shared infrastructure that can be deployed in under 2 hours total setup time.
